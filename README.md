ArtiaX is an open-source extension of the molecular visualisation program ChimeraX and is primarily intended for 
visualization and processing of cryo electron tomography data. It allows easy import and export of particle lists in 
various formats and performant interaction with the data on screen and in virtual reality.

Features include:
* Particle Picking
* Particle orientation on screen and in VR
* Isosurface visualization at particle locations
* Interactive particle sub-setting based on metadata
* Rendering particles using metadata-based colormaps
