# ArtiaX

ArtiaX is an open-source extension of the molecular visualisation program ChimeraX and is primarily aimed on processing 
data from electron microscopy. It is designed to perform visualisation, processing and manipulation / editing of objects 
quickly, intuitively and effectively. With a clearly designed user interface, the user can open several tomograms in 
short steps, load, process and save the associated motivelists and objects. The objects can be translated and rotated 
individually or as a whole, and of course new objects can be added and deleted. The plugin ties in with the possibility 
of ChimeraX to display and manipulate objects in virtual space. With ArtiaX it is possible to show and edit tomograms, 
molecular objects and entire motivelists in 3D via vs glasses. This enables a faster adjustment of incorrect spatial 
orientation of individual objects in space, an effective overview of cell structures and molecules. In this way, micro- 
and macromolecular interactions can be comprehended more easily.
