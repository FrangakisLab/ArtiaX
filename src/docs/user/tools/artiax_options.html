    <h3><a href="../artiax_index.html#tools">Tool</a>: Options</h3>

    <p> The ArtiaX <b>Options</b> tab contains the tools and setting for visualizing and
        changing tomograms and particle lists. The tab is itself divided into three tabs,
        <b>Tomogram</b>, <b>Visualization</b>, and <b>Select/Manipulate</b>. The tomogram
        or particle list that is affected by the changes made in the <b>Options</b> window
        is decided by which tab is being used and which particle list or tomogram is selected
        as "Options" in the <b><a href="artiax.html"> Artiax </a></b> window.
    </p>

            <b>Tomogram:</b>
            <p>
                The <b>Tomogram</b> tab is used to manipulate the currently selected "options"
                tomogram.

                    <b>Contrast settings:</b>
                    <p>
                        Used to set the center and width of the tomogram, used as a more intuitive
                        way of changing the contrast settings than the build in <b>Volume Viewer</b>
                        2D box.
                    </p>

                    <b>Navigation:</b>
                    <p>
                        Changes the slice direction and which slice is currently shown. The
                        "Slice Direction" lets the user input a vector used as a normal
                        vector to the slice plane. The "Slice" slider can then be used to
                        select which slice to show. The "<" and ">" jumps backward/forwards one
                        slice at a time, while "<<" and ">>" jump 10 slices at a time. <br>
                        <b>TIP</b>: Use the mouse-wheel while hovering the mouse over the slider
                        to change the slice currently shown.

                    <b>Orthoplanes:</b>
                    <p>
                        Sets the camera to view the tomogram from one of the standard directions.
                        Also changes the slice direction so that the slice plane is parallel to
                        the viewing plane.

            <b>Visualization:</b>
            <p>
                The <b>Visualization</b> tab is used to change the display options for the currently
                selected "options" particle list, and any associated surface model.
            </p>
            <ul>

                    <b>Color Settings:</b>
                    <p>
                        Used to change the color and transparency of the particles in the
                        particle list. If "Single Color" is selected all particle will get the
                        selected color. If "Colormap" is used, particles can be colored according
                        to their value with respect to some attribute.
                    </p>

                    <b>Marker/Axes Display:</b>
                    <p>
                        Changes the size of the markers and axes on the particles.

            <b>Select/Manipulate:</b>
            <p>
                The <b>Select/Manipulate</b> tab allows for selecting or showing particles based
                on attributes, and scaling and manipulation particles.

                    <b>Manipulation:</b>
                    <p>
                        Used to delete or reset particle to their original positions.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Selection/Display:</b>
                    <p>
                        Lets the user select or display particles based on some attribute. Multiple
                        selectors can be used simultaneously. Particularly useful when a particle list
                        contains information from more than one tomogram or when the particles are numbered.
                        Also works well with the "Manipulation" options.
                    </p>
