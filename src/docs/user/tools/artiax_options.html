    <h3><a href="../artiax_index.html#tools">Tool</a>: Options</h3>
    <p> The ArtiaX <b>Options</b> tab contains the tools and setting for
      visualizing and changing tomograms and particle lists. The tab is itself
      divided into three tabs, <b>Tomogram</b>, <b>Visualization</b>, and <b>Select/Manipulate</b>.
      The tomogram or particle list that is affected by the changes made in the
      <b>Options</b> window is decided by which tab is being used and which
      particle list or tomogram is selected as "Options" in the <b><a href="artiax.html">
          Artiax </a></b> window. </p>
    <ul>
      <li> <b>Tomogram:</b>
        <p> The <b>Tomogram</b> tab is used to manipulate the currently
          selected "options" tomogram. </p>
        <ul>
          <li> <b>Physical Coordinates:</b>
            <p>Set the pixel size of the tomogram or volume if it
              isn't specified in the file header.</p>
          </li>
          <li> <b>Contrast settings:</b>
            <p> Used to set the center and width of a linear contrast slope,
              used as a quick, reproducible way of changing the contrast
              settings. Contrast can still be adjusted using the <b>Volume
                Viewer</b> box if desired. By pressing the "Invert Contrast" button, a new tomogram is created for which the density values are inverted.</p>
          </li>
          <li> <b>Navigation:</b>
            <p> Changes the slice direction and which slice is currently shown.
              The "Slice Direction" lets the user input a vector used as a
              normal vector to the slice plane. The "Slice" slider can then be
              used to select which slice to show. The "&lt;" (Shortcut: F3) and
              "&gt;" (Shortcut: F4) jumps backward/forwards one slice at a time,
              while "&lt;&lt;" (Shortcut: F7) and "&gt;&gt;" (Shortcut: F8) jump
              10 slices at a time. <br>
              <b>TIP</b>: Use the mouse-wheel while hovering the mouse over the
              slider to change the slice currently shown. </p>
          </li>
          <li> <b>Orthoplanes:</b>
            <p> Sets the camera to view the tomogram from one of the standard
              directions. Also changes the slice direction so that the slice
              plane is parallel to the viewing plane. </p>
          </li>
          <li> <b>Processing:</b>
            <p> Includes different options for tomogram processing. In the "Average" section, the user can create a copy of the tomogram averaged in the set direction, using the number of nearest slabs for the averaging.
            In the "Filtering" area, the user can create a copy of the tomogram that is filtered using a Low Pass or High Pass filter.
            A Gaussian or Cosine decay can be selected. If the unit is set to pixels and the pass frequency is set to zero the center of decay will be at zero. If decay size is set to zero a box filter is used. If the unit is set to "angstrom", the decay size is always set to 1/pass*0.25.</p>
          </li>
          <li> <b>Tomogram arithmetics:</b>
            <p> GUI incorporation of arithmetic operations for tomograms. The tomogram for which the ArtiaX options tab is currently activated is the first operand.
              A second operand can be selected as well as the desired operation (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division). After pressing "Compute", a new tomogram will be generated from the result of this operation.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> <b>Visualization:</b>
        <p> The <b>Visualization</b> tab is used to change the display options
          for the currently selected "options" particle list, and any associated
          surface model. </p>
        <ul>
          <li> <b>Color Settings:</b>
            <p> Used to change the color and transparency of the particles in
              the particle list. If "Single Color" is selected all particle will
              get the selected color. If "Colormap" is used, particles can be
              colored according to their value with respect to some attribute. </p>
          </li>
          <li> <b>Marker/Axes Display:</b>
            <p> Changes the size of the markers and axes on the particles. </p>
          </li>
          <li> <b>Surface Display:</b>
            <p>Add a density map to be rendered at each particle location. One
              can either choose a map already opened in ChimeraX, or choose a
              file to be loaded. Using the Surface Level slider, the isosurface
              threshold of the map can be manipulated. </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> <b>Select/Manipulate:</b>
        <p> The <b>Select/Manipulate</b> tab allows for selecting or showing
          particles based on attributes, and scaling and manipulation particles.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li> <b>Scaling:</b>
            <p>Allows setting the units of the location and/or alignment shift
              values in the particle list. For example, if the particle list
              contains positions in pixels of a reference tomogram, all
              positions can be scaled to physical units (Angstrom) using the
              pixel size of the tomogram. The same applies to alignment shifts.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li> <b>Manipulation:</b>
            <p> Used to delete or reset particle to their original positions. </p>
          </li>
          <li> <b>Selection/Display:</b>
            <p> Lets the user select or display particles based on some
              attribute. Multiple selectors can be used simultaneously.
              Particularly useful when a particle list contains information from
              more than one tomogram or when the particles are numbered. Also
              works well with the "Manipulation" options. </p>
