    <p> The <b>Artiax Window</b> is used to handle tomograms and particle lists. It lets the
        user see information about the models, show or hide them, decide which model to change the
        options for using the <b><a href="artiax_options.html">Artiax Options</a></b> tab, and create, save, load
        and add models.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Tomograms:</b>
            <p>
                The tomograms box contains a table with all the loaded tomograms which shows their IDs, names, if
                they're being displayed or not, and if they are the currently selected "options" tomogram or not.
                The box also contains buttons for opening a tomogram, closing the currently highlighted tomogram, as
                well as adding tomograms already loaded into ChimeraX to ArtiaX, allowing them to be manipulated using
                the <b>Tomogram</b> tab in the <b><a href="artiax_options.html">Artiax Options</a></b> tab.

            <b>Particle lists:</b>
            <p>
                The particle list box contains a table with all the loaded particle lists which shows their IDs, names, if
                they're being displayed or not, and if they are the currently selected "options" particle list or not.
                The box also contains buttons for creating a new, empty particle list, opening a saved particle list, as
                well as saving or closing the currently highlighted particle list.
