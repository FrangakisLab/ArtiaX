    <p>
    The <b>artiax fit surface</b> command fits a surface that goes through the currently selected particles. The
      surface is assumed to be defined by a function w = f(u,v), where w is taken to be the normal of the selected
      points, which is calculated before the surface is interpolated using the singular value decomposition. The plane
      orthogonal to the normal is taken as the u,v plane. The surface can be created using a linear, cubic, or nearest
      neighbor approach. The number of points used to define the surface can be changed with the resolution setting. A
      base level can also be set, allowing the surface to be defined in the whole bounding box surrounding the
      particles. Particles can also be created along the surface.
