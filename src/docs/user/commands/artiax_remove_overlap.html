    <p> The <b>artiax remove overlap</b> command moves particles with attached surfaces in an iterative manner until
     the surfaces of the particles no longer overlap. If no particle lists are specified, all selected particles with
     attached surfaces are moved. Particle lists specified with the 'freeze' keyword will be included in the overlap
     calculations, but will not be moved. The 'manifold' keyword can be used when particles are attached to a geometric
      model, in which case the particles will be moved along the while remaining oriented away from the surface.
      Useful in combination with the <a href="artiax_generate_points_on_surface.html"> <i>artiax gen on surface</i></a>
        command. Similarly, the 'boundary' keyword can be used when particles are placed inside a geometric model,
      in which case the particles will be moved without being moved outside the specified geometric model. Useful
    in combination with the <a href="artiax_generate_points_in_surface.html"><i>artiax gen in surface</i></a> command.
    Two methods are available for calculating the overlap between the surfaces, chosen by the 'method' keyword. The
    default, 'distance', estimates the distance two surfaces overlap, and is generally the quicker and better option.
    But for some geometries, or in cases where very high or low precision is needed, the 'volume' method can be used,
    which estimates the volume of the overlap and moves the particles away from each other's centers. Using this method,
    the keywords 'thoroughness', 'precision', and 'iterations' can be used to get a specified precision.</p>

          particles have to start on the geometric model. If the curvature of the geometric model is very large, the particles might
          move away from it. The particles are automatically oriented such that the z-axis points away from the geometric

          particles are kept away from the geometric model with the help of the 'maxSearchDistance' parameter, which
