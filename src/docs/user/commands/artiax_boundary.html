    <br><b>artiax boundary</b></h3>

    <p>
    The <b>artiax boundary</b> command creates a boundary model around all currently selected particles. The boundary
      is an alpha shape which can be controlled by the alpha setting. An alpha value of 1 creates the convex hull of
      the selected points, whereas an alpha value of 0 only leaves the smallest tetrahedron possible. The <b>Delete
      Tetra</b> mouse mode can be used to delete unwanted tetrahedrons. Note however that the computation time
      increases linearly with every deleted tetrahedron. The boundary model can be used to reorient particles.
      Particles that are being used as vertices on the boundary will be reoriented such that their z-axis points along
      the average normal of all triangles connected to the vertex. All particles which are not used as a vertex get
      reoriented along the normal of the closest triangle.
