    <br><b>artiax fit line</b></h3>

    <p>
    The <b>artiax fit line</b> command fits a line that goes through the currently selected particles. The line is made
      by fitting either a first, third, or fifth degree polynomial. The number of points used to define the line can be
      changed with the resolution setting, and the line can be given a smoothness, so that it is not forced to go
      through all particles perfectly. Particles can be created along the line with an even spacing. These particles
      can also be rotated in a helix-like manner.
